Caution:

While the containers are setting themselves up there is a time
period (lasting about a second on the machine the build was tested
on), in which the minio container stops MinIO, says it has finished
setting up, and starts MinIO again (the logs of those operations can
be found in the logs of the minio service).

I've noticed, that during the execution of the above actions, if the
MinIO server receives a lot of requests in a short period of time,
it takes it very long to respond, even if the storage is empty and
requests are only asking for a list of stored objects (not even
requesting any downloads). This in effect makes my server not
responsive as well, while the time period lasts.

I have been able to reproduce the behavior at will during the described
time period, and unable to reproduce the behavior outside the described
time period.

Please, keep that in mind when testing and using the endpoints provided
by my server.
